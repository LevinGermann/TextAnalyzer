 I read this book years ago, so I do not remember specific details.  I gave this book 3 stars b/c it was a fascinating read.  Did I enjoy it? A little, but not really.  This is a book that everyone was talking about at the time, so that was my main reason for indulging.  It was pretty formulaic to me. No different from any other such book.
