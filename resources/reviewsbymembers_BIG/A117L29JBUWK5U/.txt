 This book is an extensive guide to a very large number of schools. It has all the basic facts about these schools, as well as insider information from students that you won't find in the admissions pamphlets you were sent. However, much of this data is out of date. The numbers are at least three years old for a lot of the schools I was looking at: tuition is understated and enrollment figures are off. The book is also riddled with typos, mainly in the numbers department. Despite poor editing, it is still a useful guide to have. Although, I might add, what the students said about the school I chose was way off, so take their advice with a grain of salt.
