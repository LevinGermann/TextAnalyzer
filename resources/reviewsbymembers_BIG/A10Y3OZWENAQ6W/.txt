    The Two Minute Rule is a very entertaining crime novel. There are well written, sympathetic characters and an interesting plot.  The  solution to the mystery   makes sense unlike some novels where the author throws in an ending  where you think "Where did that come from?".       The  story begins with a failed bank robbery. Several months later a bank robber is released from prison. He learns that his son, who he last saw as a child  has been murdered. His son was a police officer. The excon enlists the aid of a former FBI agent to help solve the murder.         I enjoyed this book very much. I read it long into the nights. The story moves very fast.
