 ........... somebody wake me when this guy's career is over...... there is a CD on the Naive label of settings of popular tunes of the day by Beethoven, which clearly shows that while you can elevate the pop song with an incredible classical melody, it don't work the other way around. It's a GREAT POP CD. This is CRAP.
