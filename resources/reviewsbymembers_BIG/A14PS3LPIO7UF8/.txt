 I first read 1984 as a teen; and it's imagery and parameters of political analysis have stayed with me, and grown ever since. It is one of the most important works of the 20th century.  Orwell crafted a brilliant picture of how a totalitarian oligarchy can exist and thrive. There isn't a single element in teh book that cannot be found in the history of the world of the past 50 years; in all nations, all places, all times, all peoples.  We have all seen how doublethink works; and, if we were really honest, we've experienced it in our own lives and performed it - doubtless to perfection. Human beings have a genius for lying to themselves and believing every word of it.  There are two flaws in the book. One is that Orwell's vison tackled only half of the danger facing us. True, in, for example, present day USA under the domination of the Bush-led Neocon Regime, we see many of the Orwellian principles in action. But I belive that Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" lent eloquent imagery to the other half of the equation. Combine a balance of the Orwellian (oligarcy established and sustained by brutality, torture, brainwashing, and oppression) and Huxlian elements (oligarcy established and sustained by diversion through drug abuse, sexual amorality, and mind-numbing entertainment) and you will have a picture of the world in which we live.   The other is that he completly ignored the element of economics and how manipulation of, and indeed, application of the Orwellian and Huxlian principles upon, economics and finance are essential to the establishment of a world dictatorship. The reader is advised to examine the workings and infrastructure of, for example, the IMF, the World Bank, and the SWIFT network.  And make no mistake, we do live there. Human beings are ceasing to be human. I could write for hours listing evidence of this: and so could you.   Having said that, I believe this book to possess a valuable weapon against tyrrany and dehumanization for all people. The whole of humanity is richer for having such a warning in place. Perhaps someone will listen.
