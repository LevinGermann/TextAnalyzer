 Well, to put it bluntly, this sounds like the hardcore/grindcore adaptation of Mr. Bungle's Disco Volante, except that it's not nearly as weird.  Specifically, adpatations of the songs like 'Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz' and 'Carry Stress in the Jaw'.  But anyway, comparisons aside, this is an amazing band.  I never knew scales could be played so fast.  The only thing that bothers me about this, is that the guy's vocals are nothing special and the lyrics aren't all that great.  But it doesn't really matter because you can't understand him most of the time anyway.  Neat stuff.
