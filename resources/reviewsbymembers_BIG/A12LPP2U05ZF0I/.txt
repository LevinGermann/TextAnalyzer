 Reveille is one of the best bands around. They are probably the hardest rap-core band out there. Anyone that dislikes this band just hates metal. It's as simple as that. Reveille is a great band, and I hope you guys don't miss tha chance to check em live. I think that they, like most bands, are better live.  This band really can't be compared to many others, but I would have to say that they are a heavier, more energetic Adema. Their songs always contain screaming and great drumming. They have some of the best talent as far as music goes. No song on this CD is rated below a 4, except for an interlude (#10). Below is my track rating (1-5): 1. Unborn - 5 2. What You Got - 4 3. Look At Me Now - 5 4. Modified Lie - 4.5 5. Comin Back - 4.5 6. Killing Me - 4.5 7. Bleed The Sky - 5 8. Inside Out - 5 9. Catarax - 4.25 10. Down To None - 3.5 (interlude that sounds like Gorillaz) 11. Derelict - 4 12. Plastic - 5  13. Farewell Fix - 4.5 14. Inside Out Remix - 4 (the original version is much better)
