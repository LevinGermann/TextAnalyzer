  Whether you're serious or not about the martial arts, I strongly recommend this book.  Trouble is, if you're not serious you won't understand a lot of it.  Many of the concepts and theory presented are complex and require a strong background in martial arts to understand. Regardless, any beginner will be better off for having read it.  This is one of those books you'll read more than once because there is so much of Bruce's insight contained within this book.  The book is not an exciting read, but it's one that you'll always keep.  Tao contains Bruce's philosophy, mind set, and techniques that made him unique.  I rated the book as 4 stars only because it's not necessarily an enjoyable read, but it's a great one.
