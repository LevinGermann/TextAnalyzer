 Ne, minna, great movie.  I love it.   The subtitles are fairly good, and the storyline absolutely rocks. And it is NOT Boujishi or Bishoji or whatever people have put down.  It is Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, or technically Bishjo Senshi Sailor Moon S.  If you try to get Japanese info, do it right!  I'm young too y'know.   Anyway, this movie was a great finale to BSSMS.  Only problem I have with it is that the coloring on the cover is kinda...messed up.  Ja ne, minna!  *blows kisses* ~Crysdel
