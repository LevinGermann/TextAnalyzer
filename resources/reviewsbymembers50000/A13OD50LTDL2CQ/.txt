 THIS IS THE FULLY DEVELOPED RUSH OF THEIR 'EARLY PERIOD'...AND I CONSIDER THIS CLASSIC OF AN EXCITING ALBUM 'EARLY RUSH' ALONG THE LINES OF CARRESS OF STEAL AND FLY BY NIGHT...THE BIG CHANGES WOULD COME WITH KINGS AND HEMISPHERES A LITTLE LATER ON WHERE ALEX'S GUITAR WOULD START SINGING IT'S OWN LITTLE CATCHY SONG PARTS WITHIN SONGS...THIS RUSH ALBUM HERE IS MEAN, FIERCE CAPTAIN BEYOND-LIKE PROG THAT EXPLODES WITH PASSION AND ANGER...LIKE ALL RUSH IT IS LOADED WITH AMBIANCE AND BRADY BUNCH LIKE MELODIES BUT PACKAGED TO EXPLODE LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB...GEDDY AND NEIL ROCK OUT COMPLICATED BUT ALEX IS MORE THAN HANGING ON FOR THE RIDE...THE SONGS DO GET MELLOW AFTER A WHILE BUT THATS OK...RUSH WERE 'FINDING THEIR WAY'....A FIVE STAR CLASSIC EPIC ! BUY THIS NOW AND TELL A FRIEND !
