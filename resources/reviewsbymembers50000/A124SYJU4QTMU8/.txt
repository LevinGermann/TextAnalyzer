 I bought this DVD because it said 1969 as the publication date. Don't be fooled. The DVD is pieces from different eras. There are a few bits that can be from 1969 (the disco scene, obviously!), but the live action scenes were from the 80's, judging by the way the clothes look. It's a nice video and my daughter seems to like it. Just don't buy this DVD if you want to go down memory lane with your kids!
