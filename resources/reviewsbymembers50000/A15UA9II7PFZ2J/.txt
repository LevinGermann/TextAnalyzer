 Alright i know i probably will get alot of flack coming from the dreamcast and nintendo camps, but sory i gotta say what i think is the truth. Playstation was the system that revolutionized video gaming as we know it. Granted dreamcast is out and yes PS2 is also out and in my opinion is leaving playstation to be forgotten which is sad. I have owned a playstation for 3 years and have thirteen games for it, so i know what i am talking about. I will most likely stay loyal to playstation, there will half to come along a system that knocks my socks off to get me to be a traitor. thanks for reading and i hope it has helped you make up your mind if you are dciding what system to buy.
