 The unfortunate result of hype is that expectations are raised to such a fever pitch, the artist in question becomes an inevitable letdown.  This -- thank God -- is not the case w/ Damien Rice.  This is the closest thing to instant love I've felt for an album in a long time.  The Amazon review is absolutely right -- Rice's maturity is startling. He successfully rides a sophisticated line between accesible and challenging material. His work is unabashedly emotive, but always sincere. The depression is exquisite, and so is the beauty.  Absolute yum.
