 Negatives: Expensive. There are not enough diagrams and pictures. Leaves much to the imagination. Some areas not well organized. Positives: most detailed textbook related to critical care without being a medical textbook and cater toward nursing. Excellent pathophysiology descriptions. Everything is broken down to the most basic cellular level. I never knew how much I did not know until I read this book. Highly recommended.
