 No Question about it, this album definitely surpasses "My Way". Some highlights of the album are "You Remind Me", which is about a guy who can't get together with a girl because she reminds him of his ex, "If I want to", a cocky song about a guy that can take a girl from her boyfriend without any effort ("if I want it I could take you from your man/I could have you eating out the palm of my hand"), and, "Separated", a slow song that has some of the best lyrics I've heard in a while. ("If love was a fire than we have lost the spark/if love was a light we'd be lost in the dark/if love was a sport we're not on the same team/ if love was a choir then I could never sing/if love was an Oscar you and I could never win"). Those are some of the lyrics, and they pretty much sum up this amazing song. I gave this album only 4 stars because there a couple songs I don't like, such as "I can't let you go", which features P. Diddy. But overall, very good album. I suggest it.
